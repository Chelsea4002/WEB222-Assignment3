      <h3>About author...</h3>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Hyerang Cho</strong> and my English name is Chelsea. I was born in South
        Korea and currently live in Toronto, Canada. I graduated Early Childhood Education at George
        Brown College and worked at the child care centre for two years. All of my cousins I live
        with work in the IT field and they work from home and get paid well so I decided to go back
        to school and study computer programming. So I am currently studying at Seneca College with
        a major in Computer Programming and Analysis. When I was in high school, my friend showed me
        a video of <strong>SEVENTEEN</strong>, K-Pop boy group, and since then, I have become a big
        fan of them. That's why I chose <a href="index.html">DK</a>, one of the members of
        SEVENTEEN, as my favourite artist.
